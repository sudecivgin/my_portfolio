<h1>Hi! I'm Sude</h1>
<h3 class="text-animation ">I'm<span></span></h3>
<p> Hello! I am an engineer candidate who cares about continuous self-improvement and is interested in technology. In the software world, I focus on developing user-oriented, aesthetic and functional interfaces, especially in the frontend field. I enjoy both producing and creating visually impressive works while writing code. This process gives me new experiences every time.

I don't see exploration as limited to software. 
Music, in particular, has an important place in my life and I love it so much that it can accompany almost every moment. 
Writing, blogging and putting my thoughts into words is also one of the things I enjoy the most!!

                          I gained basic experience in applying scientific methods, conducting research and presenting projects, 
                          especially by taking an active role in TUBITAK Science Fair projects.
In addition, I participated in various poetry and book narration competitions and achieved degrees. 
This process contributed to the development of my written expression skills and social skills such as public speaking.

                         The TUBITAK 4004-supported “Engineers of the Future” project, which I participated in during a summer semester, 
                         contributed to reinforcing my interest in engineering and clarifying my career goals. Thanks to this project, I improved my analytical thinking, problem solving and teamwork skills by participating in technical applications.

                <p>In the past, I gained mobile interface development experience with Flutter within the scope of my mobile-oriented studies. 
                    In this process, I tried to improve myself on mobile user experience by designing an Instagram application interface. 
                    In the future, I aim to deepen especially in React Native, and I plan to increase my mobile development skills by focusing on this area during my upcoming internship period.
